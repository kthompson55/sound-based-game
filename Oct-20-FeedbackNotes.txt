Camera collision stuff? Standard assets?
----------------------------------------
Having to manually rotate the camera sucks
Camera feels confusing
If the camera were closer to the player
When I die, I can't start the game again
After falling down, it can be difficult to see my player again, because of conflicingt walls.
What is all this weird stuff on the floor? It looks like electricity
Camera keeps getting lost.
I'm not sure I'm going the right way
I'm pretty sure I'm not supposed to go under the walls
I don't get why I went from walking into a bright light and transporting to the main menu
It doesn't feel like the exit felt like a natural progression
Can't restart the game
Top-down camera view? Default standard asset. FIND IT. (ProtectCameraFromWall, or something like that)
Health bar didn't show up
--------------------------
I like the movement 
The camera is really weird
Jumping is way too strong, I hit the ceiling every time
Mouse control for the camera
I'm not really sure what my goal is
Z-Fighting
Which way did I go
Everything is really shiny
There's some really intense lighting (default textures suck)
Where do I go from here?
Jumping is really intense
The height is okay, but it needs to be slower on the ascent and descent
Tapping vs. holding space bar should have varying heights
Really cool start
----------------------------
Final area, the player can float between two platforms
Camera is annoying!! 
Fun
Traps don't hurt the player within the trap area
